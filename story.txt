This here's a tail for all the fellas
tryin do what those ladies tell us
get shot down cause ya over zealous
play hard to get females get jealous
okay smarty go to a party
girls are scantily clad and showin body
a chick walks by and you wish you could sex her
but your standing on the wall like you was Poindexter
next days function high class luncheon
food is served and your stone cold munchin

music comes on people start to dance
but then you ate so much you nearly split you pants
a girl starts walking guys start gawking 
sits down next to you and starts talking

Ah we can dance if we want to, we can leave your friends behind
Cause your friends don't dance and if they don't dance
Well they're are no friends of mine
I say, we can go where we want to, a place where they will never find
And we can act like we come from out of this world
Leave the real one far behind,
And we can dance
